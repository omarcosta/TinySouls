LICENSE

The game developer who purchased the product has the right to use the music in games designed for commercial purposes. Therefore, if Intersonic Sound products are purchased, it gives you this right and there is no extra cost.
There is no Content ID based restriction procedure, such as "copyright claim" automation, which can prevent monetization of the video or cause a channel to receive a warning if the products are used in any YouTube content. You can use it as you wish in your videos. Bringing Intersonic Sound products under YouTube Content ID by any application is not an attempt we allow.
If our products are used in content transmitted via any live stream, pre-recorded video or similar streaming service, broadcasters are not required to reference (or write down) the name of the Intersonic Sound team. But if this is done, we would of course be grateful.
There are no restrictive rules or recurring payments for the duration of the licenses. As a result, the validity period of the license you have already obtained with the purchase is not shortened by any other rules or taken out of the contexts mentioned above.
Intersonic Sound products belong to the Intersonic Sound team that produces the products and retains the ownership rights. In this context, no person or institution can own the products, sell the products directly, and agree with digital distribution companies such as Spotify for the display of the products in a non-game format.
